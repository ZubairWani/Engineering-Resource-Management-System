## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.x or higher recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed locally or a connection string from MongoDB Atlas.

### 1. Backend Setup

First, set up the server and seed the database.

1.  **Navigate to the `backend` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   Create a new file named `.env` in the `backend` directory.
    -   Copy the content from `.env.example` (if it exists) or use the template below.
    -   **Important:** Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string_here` with your actual MongoDB connection URL.

    ```env
    # .env
    MONGODB_URL="your_mongodb_connection_string_here"
    BACKEND_PORT=8081
    NODE_ENV="development"
    JWT_SECRET="a-very-strong-secret-key-for-development"
    ```

4.  **Seed the database:**
    -   This command will clear the database and populate it with sample users, projects, and assignments.
    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```

5.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8081`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

Next, set up the React client.

1.  **Open a new terminal** and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## üìã How to Use the Application

The database is seeded with pre-defined users to allow for easy testing of both roles.

### Login Credentials

Use the following credentials on the login page:

| Role      | Email               | Password      | Notes                                                                |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Manager**   | `manager@test.com`  | `manager123`  | Has full access to dashboards, projects, engineers, and timeline.     |
| **Engineer**  | `senior@test.com`   | `engineer123` | Can view their assignments and edit their profile.                   |
| **Engineer**  | `junior@test.com`   | `engineer123` | A part-time engineer to test capacity calculations.                  |
| **Engineer**  | `zubairwani49@gmail.com`   | `password123` | A Full-time engineer to test capacity calculations.                  |



**Note:** When you create a **new engineer** from the manager dashboard, they are automatically assigned the password **`password123`** and can be used for login.
